    <p class="seperator">i'll make more later</p>
    <p class="emphasis">what is this</p>
    <p class="pgradgreen" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">a low effort website with random music and words</p>
    <p class="emphasis">1/1/2026 2:26 PM:</p>
    <p class="pgradgreen">i had to reset my pc cuz i accidentally formatted my drive so i'll put more music here later
        i know im acting like this is the biggest website in the world but its an archive for me to put music, vents, or just how im feeling,
        also happy new years!
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;"></p>
    <p class="emphasis">consequences:</p>
    <p class="pgradgreen">mostly a test instrumental i made cuz i got bored.
        theres meaning to the song but most of it lies in the name rather than the actual song.
        i named it consequences bc of what one would expect:
    </p>
    <p class="duh">consequences,</p>
    <p class="pgradgreen">but to elaborate i used to be the most insufferable peice of shit to everyone around me
        no clue why i was like that, no way of excusing it but i was an asshole. i'd lie about everything, my age, my entire life, so much so that it got down to my name.
        its not like i didnt trust the people i lied to, they were my closest friends and some of them still are to this day.
        i was a kid when i did but still, i gave ppl trust issues
